# Assignment 3 - Refactoring

For this assignment you will be refactoring products of another group. To that
end this folder contains four folders: dyingCats, chatBots and howItsMade. You can refactor any project, as long as it's 
**not the project you did for assignment 2.**
These contain code from a group that completed that 
assignment.

## GitHub Details

**Important:** once you've determined the project you will be refactoring, place
the content of the corresponding folder (containing pom.xml and at least the
src-folder) in the folder assignment3. That way it's clear to you, us, and
CircleCI where we can find your project, as well as eliminating noise from other
projects sitting around doing nothing.

**Moreover:** Please make a new branch (assignment3 for example) and create a
pull request from that branch to master. Do this once your project has been 
placed in the assignment3-folder but **before** you do any refactorings.
That way we can use GitHub to check the changes you've made more easily.

**Finally:** If you've made a certain refactoring, please note it on the final
pull request. After many refactorings a number of refactorings won't necessarily
be obvious to an outside party (which is kind of the point), but it will be
easier to appreciate it once its written down.

The deadline for your pull request with refactorings to master is 
October 8nd, 09:00.

## Final Notes

One thing central to refactoring is that tests must continue to pass. For the
current projects there are unfortunately no tests. Tested code is better than
untested code, meaning that adding tests is in a sense a refactoring. The same
is true for comments, _which are surprisingly rare this year_.
Keep in mind, however, that we really want to see a change in the code. It's not
sufficient to just add tests and comments.

Refactoring a project of your fellow students is a realistic practice of how things happen in the real world, when you have to continuously improve on the work of your colleagues.

Good luck!
