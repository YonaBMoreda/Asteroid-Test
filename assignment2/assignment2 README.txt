Dear Students,

in this folder you will find three assignments. 
You are free to choose one of the three assignments to work on. 

Also in this folder is a pom.xml. I would like to reiterate here that changing the circle.yml or using any other build tool than maven will result in an unaccepted submission.

For this lab there is an intermediary feedback session. To join it **You have to make a pull request before monday 09:00 next week**. We'll then schedule you for the lab session the days after.


Kind regards,

The TAs
